Data taken from kaggle were trained using linear regression model and XGBoost model (with parameters n_estimators and max_depth ).
From the model training carried out, the best model is obtained, namely the XGBRegressor model with parameters n_estimators = 20 and max_depth = 7. So that the RMSE of the model is obtained by Train RMSE: 389711.43892490363, Test RMSE: 396153.42923478055
